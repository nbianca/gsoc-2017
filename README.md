# Bianca Nenciu's Summer with Discourse

Hello! This is the report of my progress made with [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/) over the summer. My mentor is [Sam Saffron](https://github.com/SamSaffron).

## What is here

### `patches` directory

For each project I contributed to, I created a directory that contains all of my patches for that specific repository.

These patches were generated using `git log --author="Bianca Nenciu" --pretty=format:"%h"` and `git format-patch -1 $SHA`.

### `reports` directory

In the `reports` directory you can find all of my weekly reports.
