## Week 06 <sup>3rd July - 9nd July</sup>
- Worked on the MP4-to-GIF plugin I wrote about in my proposal. I got to a working prototype: any GIF that was uploaded would trigger a file upload event that would use `convert` (which is a component of ImageMagick) to convert the new GIF file to MP4. This approach only works for those GIFs that were uploaded, but I consider it a success.
- Started working on a Travis configuration for Discourse plugins. There were a few difficulties, but nothing major. This should prevent merging faulty commits.
- This week was quite slow. I had some trouble with my laptop. My old hard-drive failed and lost a big part of the work I did for this week. Good thing is that I still remembered what I had to do and how to, bad thing is that I had to setup my environment on a borrowed laptop and on mine, after I fixed it. I did reimplement bug fixes to the bugs that were reported on meta and tested everything again to make sure no bug got through.

### Challenges
- “If anything can go wrong, it will.” :sadpanda:
