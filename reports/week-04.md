## Week 04 <sup>19th June - 25th June</sup>
- Worked on Canned Replies plugin. Sam told me the canned replies is an important plugin for Discourse and required a little revamp.
- I did some research on this plugin to see which aspects can be improved. I came up with a mock-up and posted [here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/canned-replies-plugin-update/64904/), on Meta.
- The current plugin did not have a very user friendly interface. Sam suggested that it would be ideal to have details about canned replies in the preview pane. This required me to change a part of the core to add plugin outlets in editor's preview pane.
- I got a few suggestions about the mock-up and by the end of the week, I had a good design in mind. Please, see [this](https://meta.discourse.org/t/canned-replies-plugin-update/64904/).
- I also did some research on some of the things I originally proposed in my [GSoC proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-8zFaDZtoCtZWMldhzUzSVHru3_D8j0o7hFSY_jHOY/).

### Challenges
- I believe this week was quite straight-forward. There was nothing of a big complexity here. :smirk:
