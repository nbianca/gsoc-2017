## Week 12 <sup>14th August - 20th August</sup>

* I helped merging a long due pull request that was submitted by @gsambrotta.
* I did some more changes to get my pull requests into a mergeable state.
* I banged my head against the wall to solve the remaining issues with the pull requests I sent. Writing the right tests is hard and I had to make some changes to one pull request that actually changed the expected behavior and had to rewrite the tests.

### Challenges
- I started hating writing tests. On my machine, it takes a while to run all unit tests and for some of my changes I needed to reseed the database everytime, which was a pain.
