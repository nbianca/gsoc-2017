## Week 09 <sup>24th July - 30th July</sup>

* This week I focused on the PM to email functionality. The expected behavior was to be able to send private messages to email addresses. Currently, private messages can be sent only to users. To send a private message to an email address, a staged user (which can be considered some sort of temporary user) is created and used for correspondence.

### Challenges
- Understanding the existent code for private messages.
- Properly testing was difficult, as I mentioned in the report for the previous week.
