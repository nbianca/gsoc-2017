## Week 05 <sup>26th June - 2nd July</sup>
- Actually implemented the changes I proposed in the past week. Changes got merged, bugs were reported. I fixed those and pushed the changes.
- Started working on another thing that was wanted by some users: adding variables inside canned replies. Basically `@user`, `@op`, etc. would get replaced with the actual username of current user or the username of the original poster, etc. I still have issues with this. Sometimes (after navigating to another page without refresh), the information I need is not present.

### Challenges
- Most of the work I did on Discourse :discourse: until now was mostly bug fixes. Now, I had to implement something new was a little bit more difficult to me. :sweat:
