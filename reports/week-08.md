## Week 08 <sup>17th July - 23th July</sup>
- The quick access menu I implemented before GSoC was broken. It broke mainly due to the fact that there was some refactoring and the feature was not merged than because of a bug. Fixing it required some refactoring.
- I struggled for like two days to get a good development box where I could have used the mail server. I tried using my own computer and forwarding those ports I needed, but failed. I think my ISP is blocking my connection. I asked a friend of mine to lend me one of his Digital Ocean boxes where I could get everything working.
- I believe that I have a some idea on how the “pm to email” users should work. Basically, it is more of a “pm to a staged user”. In case a staged user does not exist yet, it will be created when the PM is sent. More on this, soon.

### Challenges
- DevOps is harder than it looks like (configuring server). :angry::anger:
